# Solstice - Changelog

We adhere to the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- We now parse the `filter` property of p2 requirements and use it in queries. ([#45](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/45))
- If an ASCII table is too wide, we now add a legend like `ยน feature.feature.group` at the bottom so the rows can be narrower. ([#46](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/46))

## [0.8.0] - 2023-01-06
### Added
- Add tools to help debug classpath issues. ([#43](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/43))
  - Rename `IdeMain` to `BUildPluginIdeMain` because it has a weird interface that only makes sense for our build plugins.
  - Add `enum DebugClasspath` for dumping all classpath entires (names or full paths)
  - Stop sorting classpath entries implicitly, make it explicit via `Launcher.copyAndSortClasspath`, which is now used by all build plugins.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-01-06
### Added
- `IdeMain` has gained a `-useAtomos true` flag which, when enabled, uses [Atomos](https://github.com/apache/felix-atomos) as a single-classloader OSGi connector to Equinox. This is used instead of the OSGi runtime which is built-in to Solstice. ([#36](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/36))
  - It is recommended to set `-useAtomos true` for the foreseeable future, because it has better compatibility with existing applications.
  - For simple applications, you can experiment with `-useAtomos false`.
- Improve process launching. ([#39](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/39))
- Respect optionality of p2 requirements. ([#41](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/41) fixes [#35](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/35))
